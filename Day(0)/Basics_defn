# 💻 What is a Programming Language?

A **programming language** is a formal language that provides instructions for a computer to execute.
It's how **humans communicate with computers** to create software, applications, and other technology.

## 🔰 Types of Programming Languages

There are basically two types of programming languages:

1. **High Level Programming Language (HLL)**
2. **Low Level Programming Language (LLL)**

---

## 🧠 Understanding the Levels

* 🖥️ **Computer understands only:**
  **Binary Language / Assembly Language / Low Level Programming Language**

* 👨‍💻 **High Level Language:**
  Written by **humans**, easy to understand and write.

## 🔄 High Level to Low Level Conversion

Done using: **Compiler / Interpreter**

### 🛠️ Compiler:

* Converts **entire code at once**
* **Shows all errors** at once

### 🧪 Interpreter:

* Converts **code line-by-line**
* **Shows error one by one**, as it goes

---

## ✅ Advantages

* **Compiler used by:** C++
  *Slow in analyzing the code but runs faster*

* **Interpreter used by:** Python
  *Fast in analyzing the code but runs slower*

## 📊 Comparison Table

| **Feature**        | **Compiler**                         | **Interpreter**                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Work**           | Pura code ek saath convert karta hai | Code ko line-by-line execute karta hai  |
| **Speed**          | Fast (execution time)                | Slow (execution time)                   |
| **Error Handling** | Sab errors baad mein dikhata hai     | Pehli error pe hi ruk jata hai          |
| **Output**         | Ek alag executable file banata hai   | Koi file nahi, seedha code chalaata hai |
| **Example**        | C, C++, Java (compilation step)      | Python, JavaScript                      |

## 🐍 Python

**Python** is a **versatile**, **high-level**, **general-purpose programming language**
designed for **readability** and **ease of use**.
