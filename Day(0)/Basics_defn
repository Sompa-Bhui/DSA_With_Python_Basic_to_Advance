What is a Programming Language?
Ans:- A programming language is a formal language that provides instructions for a computer to execute. 
  It's how humans communicate with computers to create software, applications, and other technology..

  There are basically two types of programming language :
  1) High Level Programming Language (HLL)
  2) Low Level Programming Language (LLL)

  # Computer understand only Binary Language / Assembly Language/ Low Level Programming Language
  # High Level Language:- Which is write by humans

  # High Level to Low Level Language: [Compiler/ interpreter]
Compiler:- It converts all code by once. [Give Error at once]
Interpreter:- It converts all code by line line. [Give Error line by line as well as] 

  ADVANTAGES:--
  Compiler use by cpp
  Interpreter used by python...

|  Feature              |      Compile                          |    Interpreter                           |

|    **Work**           | Pura code ek saath convert karta hai   | Code ko line-by-line execute karta hai  |
|    **Speed**          | Fast (execution time)                  | Slow (execution time)                   |
|    **Error Handling** | Sab errors baad mein dikhata hai       | Pehli error pe hi ruk jata hai          |
|    **Output**         | Ek alag **executable file** banata hai | Koi file nahi, seedha code chalaata hai |
|     **Example**        | C, C++, Java (compilation step)        | Python, JavaScript                      |
