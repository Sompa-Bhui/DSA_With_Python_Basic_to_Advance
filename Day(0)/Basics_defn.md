# 💻 What is a Programming Language?

A **programming language** is a formal language that provides instructions for a computer to execute.
It's how **humans communicate with computers** to create software, applications, and other technology.

---

## 🔰 Types of Programming Languages

There are basically two types of programming languages:

1. **High Level Programming Language (HLL)**
2. **Low Level Programming Language (LLL)**

---

## 🧠 Understanding the Levels

* 🖥️ **Computer understands only:**
  **Binary Language / Assembly Language / Low Level Programming Language**

* 👨‍💻 **High Level Language:**
  Written by **humans**, easy to understand and write.

---

## 🔄 High Level to Low Level Conversion

Done using: **Compiler / Interpreter**

### 🛠️ Compiler:

* Converts **entire code at once**
* **Shows all errors** at once

### 🧪 Interpreter:

* Converts **code line-by-line**
* **Shows error one by one**, as it goes

---

## ✅ Advantages

* **Compiler used by:** C++
  *Slow in analyzing the code but runs faster*

* **Interpreter used by:** Python
  *Fast in analyzing the code but runs slower*

## 📊 Comparison Table

| **Feature**        | **Compiler**                         | **Interpreter**                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Work**           | Pura code ek saath convert karta hai | Code ko line-by-line execute karta hai  |
| **Speed**          | Fast (execution time)                | Slow (execution time)                   |
| **Error Handling** | Sab errors baad mein dikhata hai     | Pehli error pe hi ruk jata hai          |
| **Output**         | Ek alag executable file banata hai   | Koi file nahi, seedha code chalaata hai |
| **Example**        | C, C++, Java (compilation step)      | Python, JavaScript                      |

# ⚠️ Disadvantages of Python

Although Python is a powerful and widely used language, it has several limitations that may impact certain use cases:

---

## 🔻 1. Slower Execution Speed
- **Reason:** Python is an interpreted language and not compiled to native machine code.
- **Impact:** Slower performance compared to compiled languages like C, C++, or Java, especially in CPU-bound tasks.

---

## 🔻 2. High Memory Usage
- **Reason:** Dynamic typing and built-in data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries) use more memory.
- **Impact:** Not ideal for applications where memory optimization is critical, such as mobile or embedded systems.

---

## 🔻 3. Limited Mobile and Browser App Support
- **Reason:** Weak native support for mobile platforms and no integration with browsers.
- **Impact:** Rarely used for mobile app development or client-side web development (unlike Swift, Kotlin, or JavaScript).

---

## 🔻 4. Runtime Errors
- **Reason:** Dynamically typed — types are checked at runtime, not compile time.
- **Impact:** Bugs may appear unexpectedly during execution if not properly tested.

---

## 🔻 5. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
- **Reason:** CPython uses the GIL to manage memory access.
- **Impact:** Prevents true multithreading in CPU-bound operations, limiting parallelism.

---

## 🔻 6. Packaging and Dependency Issues
- **Reason:** Inconsistent packaging ecosystem, especially with packages that depend on native C extensions.
- **Impact:** Can lead to version conflicts and complex environment setup in larger projects.

---

## 🔻 7. Not Suitable for Low-Level Programming
- **Reason:** High-level abstractions and automatic memory management.
- **Impact:** Less control over system hardware and memory — not ideal for writing device drivers or operating systems.

---

> 💡 **Tip:** Despite these drawbacks, Python remains an excellent choice for rapid development, data science, scripting, and automation.
