## Summary:-


## Loops in Python
Loops are used to repeat instructions.

### While Loops:-

while condition:
  #some work

## Break and Continue:-

### Break:-
Used to terminate the loop when encountered.

### Continue:
Terminates execution in the current iteration & continues executions of the loop with the next iteration.

## For Loop:-
* For loops are used for sequential traversal.
* For traversing list, string, tuples etc.

  for el in list
    #### #somework
```python
list = [1,2,3]
for el in list:
  print(el)
```

* for loop with else:
  for el in list:
  #### #someworks
  else:
    #### #works when loop ends
```python
for el in list:
    print(el)
else:
    print("End")
