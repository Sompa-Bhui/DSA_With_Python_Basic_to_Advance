# ðŸ”¹ While Loop

ðŸ‘‰ **Definition:**  
A `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is `True`.

### âœ… Syntax:
```python
while condition:
    # code block
```

âœ… **Example 1: Counting**

```python
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
# Output: Count: 1 â€¦ Count: 5
```

âœ… **Example 2: Infinite Loop (âš  careful)**

```python
while True:
    print("Running...")
    break   # break to avoid infinite loop
```

âœ… **Example 3: While with user input**

```python
password = ""
while password != "python123":
    password = input("Enter password: ")
print("Access Granted âœ…")
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Use case:**

- When you donâ€™t know how many times the loop should run.  
- Runs until a condition becomes `False`.
